# Minesite

Simple "site" for making cards. Mainly created this so I can quickly look up
words with [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/), view images, and
listen to audio files in one place. The goal is to make it very fast, very easy
to use, and not require anything but a web browser. Literally just open the
index.html in your web browser and you're good to go.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

* cat (unix)
* make (gnu)
* web browser (ES2015 or higher)

### Building

Run the setup script

```console
$ ./setup
```

Then open the index.html in your favorite web browser

```console
$ firefox index.html
```

And that's it!
